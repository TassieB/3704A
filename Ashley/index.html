  <h1> Summary </h1>
  <h2>Neuroscientist Poppy Crum discusses how she thinks we can be more human if we can accept more than one reality, meaning that everyone perceives their own in their existence. She explains how people aren’t good at accepting that we experience the physical world differently and how everyone’s sensory experience is solely based on probabilities. Crum references her personal life as also being a violinist makes her prone to understand auditory sensations within their musical pitches. She also talked about how developing blind spots due to migraines helped her understand and empathize with her mother who struggled with her vision. It made her realize that you never understand a person until you consider things from their point of view. Her second point is regarding facial dysmorphia, which is a condition where one cannot see faces naturally. Francis Bacon is a painter who was known for drawing distorted faces, however, he has facial dysmorphia, so he was painting how he saw faces. His perspective on the world is considered abstract art to most people. There is a power to seeing both sides; understanding that your perspective and someone else’s is completely different. She refers to what she calls the human problem, which is that we don’t know the state of each other’s biology & its changes. Her team had developed sensory gloves that creates the feeling of the hands of people with arthritis. They gave designers these gloves and it led to them creating designs that benefitted people with arthritis in mind. This proves her final point that it is important to be vulnerable with each other for empathy between people.</h2>
