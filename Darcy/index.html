      Donald Hoffman questions if what we see and perceive in the world really is the true reality of our surroundings. Our perception is not the real reality that we exist in. I view his theory as if we are living in some kind of simulation like the Matrix. Hoffman is stating that based on the theory of evolution, we misinterpret our perceptions of the world. Based on our history, it is not the first time we have done this, just like when people believed Earth was the centre of the universe until proven otherwise. Hoffman hypothesizes that spacetime and physical objects do not exist in the way we interpret it. Each element still carries consequences and should take the items seriously (such as staying away from things that are dangerous and could impact our survival) but they do not exist in our environment literally as we see it. Hoffman is arguing that reality is like a computer desktop, and physical objects are the icons on the desktop. We see a representation of the icon, not actually what the icon is made up of and this can be applied to our physical world.

      Donald Hoffman's views center on cold cognition (intelligence quotient) rather than hot cognition (emotional quotient). Hot cognition plays a role in our perceptions of the world and human interactions, but cold cognition is responsible for developing structural ideas about our world, including spacetime, which Hoffman suggests may not be as fundamental as previously thought. He argues that spacetime cannot explain everything, and there must be something beyond this concept.

      In my opinion, I find his theory intriguing, but I remain unconvinced. I disagree with the notion that our perceptions are entirely separate from reality. I believe that our perceptions contribute to shaping our reality, and our subjective experience of reality does not necessarily have to mirror objective reality, but it is a reflection of what exists in the world. While it is possible to consider that spacetime is a construct that might not exist as we traditionally understand it, I am currently skeptical of this theory. Additionally, I find the terminology used in Hoffman's arguments confusing, especially when it comes to defining concepts like consciousness in different contexts. His reasoning for the potential proof of his argument is difficult for me to grasp, and it is complex to understand how he reaches his conclusions.

  Video 1: This video is the chosen summary video for the Cognitive Scientist Donald Hoffman. The video gives an overview of his views of reality and consciousness. Donald Hoffamn is stating what we perceive is not the true reality and evolution has guided this process.

     Several other videos delve deeper into Donald Hoffman's theory. An interview with Donald Hoffman and Lex Friman further explores his ideas and their implications.

      The overarching theme of his views is that perception serves an adaptive purpose for our survival, shaped by the consequences of our evolutionary history. While our experiences are real to us, they may not necessarily represent the full truth of reality. This perspective raises questions about the distinction between perception and actual reality. Our perceptions guide our behaviour, but they may also obscure the true nature of the world around us. This viewpoint aligns with our class's understanding of the “cogsphere”, as it suggests that our environment may not be as real as we perceive it, with various layers that we are not interpreting.

      Donald Hoffman's theory also relates to topics like niche affect and niche construction. While there is an effect of organisms interacting with their environment, the niche construction of the world our minds have created may be wrong. Our ability to manipulate the environment has evolved to our advantage, but this does not necessarily equate to an accurate representation of reality.
    </p>

      In our class, we discussed supervenience, which highlights the relationship between our brain, perceptions, and actions. Donald Hoffman challenges the idea that our neural responses accurately represent reality. I see it as, we presume that what we perceive is real but just like when connections in your brain change or get damaged your perception of the world can change too. This raises the fundamental question: what is the true reality? Hoffman presents evolution as the interface on our cognitive desktop, concealing the “true” version of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoffman's belief that consciousness is not fundamental challenges the conventional perspective held by many cognitive scientists and researchers. While they often seek to identify specific brain areas, particles, or brain activities responsible for consciousness, Hoffman argues that we should pose different questions. According to his view, consciousness constructs space and time as data structures, much like a computer system creates icons on a desktop. This perspective is related to the terms “Necktop” and “Cloudtop”. Necktop is not interpreted the same way as our conscious mind over our actions in this theory because in his view consciousness is not fundamental. Therefore, even though we have conscious experiences it is not something the brain is responsible for in humans. Consequently, the mind may transmit inaccurate knowledge and information to the digital world, the Cloudtop.

    <p>
      Hoffman's theory relies heavily on digital representations to explain how reality is shielded from us, using terms like interface, desktop, and icons. This connection with digital concepts aligns with the scope of digital humanities. However, in my view it's essential to consider how future technological advancements might challenge the analogy of reality as an interface on a desktop because theories throughout history have always been shaped by the technology innovations of that time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Hoffman, space and time are merely components of this interface and are not fundamental to our understanding of reality, suggesting that they do not exist as we traditionally perceive them.

      Hoffman highlights that consciousness has not been adequately explained by physicalist views, indicating the need for alternative approaches to understanding conscious experience. He provides an example that no known brain correlate can explain the individual experiences of the taste of chocolate. Since there is significant variability in how people experience the taste of chocolate, brain activity alone cannot account for these differences. He believes we can solve the consciousness problem if we take a different approach then this physicalist view. This part of his argument I can most agree with since the problem of consciousness has yet to be solved and is an interesting theory.

      It is well understood that we construct the reality we see based on evolution, having accurate perceptions make us fitter for survival. Donald Hoffman questions whether natural selection favours an accurate representation of reality or if, paradoxically, not seeing the whole truth provides a survival advantage. Hoffman's work has been further elaborated in his book, "The Case against Reality – Why Evolution Hid the Truth from Our Eyes."
