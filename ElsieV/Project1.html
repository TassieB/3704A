      <p>Howard Gardner is an American cognitive scientist, specializing in developmental psychology and the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Research Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University (Howard, 2022). Howard is one of the founding members behind Harvard Project Zero (HPZ), who initially focused on researching and deeply understanding the nature of artistic knowledge. Now, HPZ spans a wider spectrum of education and epistemological issues, with a mission to understand and nurture human potentials – such as learning thinking, ethics, intelligence and creativity (Harvard, 2022). He has been recognized on a global scale and is a well decorated scientist, with honorary degrees from over 30 colleges and universities, and various awards recognizing his research. More specifically, Howard proposed his theory of multiple intelligences, which breaks down the modern idea of overall intelligence into distinct types of intelligences that can each be scaled to their own unique strengths.  </p>

<!--talk about iq and intro to theory-->
	<p>In the modern age, intelligence is commonly measured by a standard test of intelligence quotient (IQ), which expresses the relative intelligence of a person. IQ was originally calculated by taking the ratio of a person’s mental age with their chronological age. Then further developed in Paris, France, through Alfred Binet and his colleagues who were tasked by city leaders to determine who would be the most successful children in elementary school (Binet & Simon, 1916; Block & Dworkin, 1976). This evolved into the first set of intelligence tests and the construct of IQ. Which eventually became the modern-day testing system that propels today’s education. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for intelligence tests to be conducted for non-educational purposes. For instance, tests are produced for every social purpose such as for teachers, supervisors, soldiers and police officers (Gould, 1981).	</p>

	<p>The issue currently as hand and that has been expressed is that the standard test of intelligence quotient is not the ideal way to test intelligence. In addition, the standardized intelligence tests heavily valorize language, mathematics and logic, which are idolized in the test taking for future endeavors like college entry. However, looking at the world as a whole and all the career opportunities available, language, mathematics and logic can only get someone so far. This is where Howard Gardner realized that perhaps intelligence should not be looked at and tested as a single measurement, but as multiple intelligences; hence his theory of multiple intelligences. Gardner believes that there are indeed 8 different intelligences that make up a person, which are: linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence and naturalist intelligence. In the more recent years Gardner has been studying more intelligences that he thinks will eventually be added to the official roster, which are: teaching or pedagogical intelligence and an existential intelligence.	</p>
