    <p>Howard Garner is an American cognitive scientist, specializing in developmental psychology and the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs Research Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University (Howard, 2022). Howard is one of the founding members behind Harvard Project Zero (HPZ), who initially focused on researching and deeply understanding the nature of artistic knowledge. Now, HPZ spans a wider spectrum of education and epistemological issues, with a mission to understand and nurture human potentials – such as learning thinking, ethics, intelligence and creativity (Harvard, 2022). He has been recognized on a global scale and is a well decorated scientist, with honorary degrees from over 30 colleges and universities, and various awards for his research. More specifically, Howard proposed his theory of multiple intelligences, which breaks down the modern idea of overall intelligence into distinct types of intelligences that can each be scaled to their own unique strengths. </p>
