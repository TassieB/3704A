  <h2 style="color:Tomato;">Video Summary: </h2>
  <p > This video explores the definition of "true intelligence" and whether or not AI can ever be truly intelligent. Melanie explains her belief that AI can never be truly intelligent until it can learn to complete tasks which are uniquely human like our ability to think abstractly and make analogies. It is believed that developmental psychology and children aquisition may be useful in figuring out how to make AI more capable of handling real-world scienarios. However, as of right now, Melanie believes that AI is not truly intelligent.</p>
