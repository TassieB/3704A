This is where he earned his Ph.D. in Cognitive Science. </p>

<p> Marvin then became a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard’s Vision Sciences Laboratory until 1996. He then started teaching as a professor of cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience at Yale University. In 2017 Marvin became the Dean of Yale University. He stepped down in 2022 because he wished to dedicate more time to his on-campus research laboratory. He also wanted to return to teaching full-time. </p>
