<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;">Marvin Chun was born and raised in California, USA. His family moved back to Korea when he was 12 years old and due to not understanding the language and culture, he faced major challenges. He struggled throughout highschool, both emotionally and academically. Marvin’s academic achievements and research contributions since graduating highschool are a testament to his resilience and determination.

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;">After graduating highschool, Marvin earned a B.A. in Psychology from Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea. In 1987 he spent a year abroad, studying for the Department of Psychology at the University of Berkeley, California. In 1990, he  received a M.A. in Psychology: Perception and Cognition, from Yonsei University. Marvin then moved back to the United States in 1990 and attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is where he earned his Ph.D. in Cognitive Science. </p>

<p style="color:#08214C;font-family: monaco, monospace; text-align:center;">Marvin then became a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard’s Vision Sciences Laboratory until 1996. He then started teaching as a professor of cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience at Yale University. In 2017 Marvin became the Dean of Yale University. He stepped down in 2022 because he wished to dedicate more time to his on-campus research laboratory. He also wanted to return to teaching full-time. </p>
