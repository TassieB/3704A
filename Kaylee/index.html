	<h4 style= "color:DarkBlue";> In his TED Talk, Neuroscientist Anil Seth explores the mystery of consciousness, emphasizing that it is a controlled hallucination generated by the brain. He discusses how our brain creates our perception of the world, our sense of self, and the importance of understanding consciousness. Seth explains his work at the University of Sussex alongside various philosophers, biologists, chemists, and physicists where they have begun to solve the mystery of what consciousness is. He believes consciousness is not solely determined by intelligence but it is rather deeply intertwined with the essence of living organisms.</h4>
