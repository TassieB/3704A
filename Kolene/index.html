					This is a recording of the 2013 ted talk of the American social psychologist Amy Cuddy. 
					In 2012 the psychologist puclished a research paper about the benefits
					of power poses. Reporting that participants of the reserach could be perceived
					as more confident during interview when they had practice a power pose for a
					given amount of time before the interview. The research cause severely critised and
					refuted later on, and is now often used as a prime example of the cause of the replication
					crisis. This idea of power pose that Cuddy is sharing aligns with the Emotional Quotient (EQ)
					concept discussed in lecture 4. Part of the research was to have blind judges
					(they did not know which participants had practices power poses) use their understanding of 
					other peoples emotional state and body language, to judge the confidence of the participants.
					It also, correctly or falsely, engages someones body language to (potentially and allegedly)
					change their mental and emotional perception of self, by making them feel more confident and
					capable.
