				<p id="intro">
					  This is a recording of the 2013 ted talk of the American social psychologist Amy Cuddy. 
					In 2012 the psychologist puclished a research paper about the benefits
					of power poses. Reporting that participants of the research had a increase in confidence, 
          felt more powerful, and had physiological changes such as higher levels of testosterone and
          lower levels of cortisol. The research was critised and refuted later on, and is now often   
          used as a prime example of the cause of the replication crisis. 
          This idea of power pose that Cuddy is sharing aligns with the Emotional Quotient (EQ)
					concept discussed in lecture 4.

        <p id="reproduction crisis">
          In 2015, I watched that ted talk, and trusted the source. Ever since, although I might not 
          have applied Cuddy's concept on a regular basis, I thought that power posing could affect me,   
          on a higher level than a placebo effect. This fall, in one of my pyschology classes, we spoke
          about the "replication crisis". In the 2010's in was realized that many psychology researches
          were hard, or not at all reproducible. When a study's reproduction is not conclusive, the 
          problem could be comming for both sides. However, if a study is not reproducible, it raises questions
          about the validity of the original conclusion and results.
