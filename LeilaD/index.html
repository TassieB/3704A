  Timnit Gebru - How To Stop Artificial Intelligence From Marginalizing Communities
</h3>
            <p>
  Timinit Gebru is a computer scientist who focuses on Algorithm Biases. In this video, she talks about automation bias, 
  where we fully trust information AI systems or algorthms are giving us and take it as fact, this can have many harmful effects.
  She also talks about surveillance AI in the US and that she does not think that it is appropiate to use such AI in high stakes situations
  such as this. She talks about how we unknowingly program our biases into AI systems, she compares not thinking about inclusivity to early Automobile
  testing, where seatbelts will only be tested on men and as a result woman and chldren were disproportionately dying in cars. She suggests that
  there should be more laws to regulate AI and it should be heavily tested before being implemented with the general public. She says as well that
  people making AI should mirror the communities they are making said AI for.
