He declares that the purpose of your memory is to “provide a map for navigating life”, meaning that the memories you form are used to aid you in reacting to events in your life.He states that you need to have some form of malevolence in your life at an early age to learn how to deal with the good and bad respectively with a level of independence, and if you cannot receive that then you will face the consequences as time passes.His main example is bullying, and how it can manifest itself with rage over time and progress into murderous fantasies (from a client of his).His ideology to prevent this in the future, as well as to limit this in current individuals is to self-reflect on how you may have played a part in bad moments and memories in your life, and that all these moments are useful to learn from and make better decisions in your next encounter. Peterson also takes the stance on being assertive in your negative environments early on to prevent the snowball effect of being bullied and other traumatic events that become repetitive in your psyche.Overall, he states that you need to build a level of immunity and confidence in yourself, so you are prepared for negative events that are inevitable in life, and you need to gain an understanding of your past to learn how to better respond in the future.');
