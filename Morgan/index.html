<h3> Video Summary/Breakdown </h3>
<p>In this video neuroscientist Andrew Huberman states that as a generation our attention spans are decreasing. Huberman's main argument is that people are unable to buffer and control their need for instant pleasure. Our proximity to pleasure today is easily accessible, the main examples Huberman provides are smartphones and social media. Many people today have smartphones, which is bad for us because of how easy it is for us to access instant pleasure with no requirement to pursue. Because of how easily we are able to access this pleasure, it creates a danger for us as we are chasing and over consuming dopamine without any effort; this causes us as a generation to develop lower attention spans and not actually find any enjoyment out of what we are doing; rather we are just becoming addicted to instant dopaminergic rushes. Everytime we scroll through social media such as tiktok or instagram it allows our brains to switch through various sources of dopamine, via scrolling through many different video contents. Normally people are required to go outside or leave the room to obtain multiple sources of dopamine, however with social media we consume thousands of different context switches in a matter of minutes. When people repeat these activities that require no effort to pursue, our motivation tends to become lower. As we overflow ourselves with these instant pleasures they eventually no longer work to give us dopamine rushes, it makes it so that we have no reason to pursue anything; thus creating an unmotivated and low attention span generation.<p> <p>Huberman suggests that we need to self-regulate because of our oversaturated dopamine circuits and control the amount of time we scroll through social media. We need to essentially work for our pleasure and dopamine rewards. Huberman describes this pursuit as “pain”, we need to experience this “pain” which will then make our reward even more rewarding. In addition, we stop engaging in our addictive behavior so our need for instant pleasure fades away. Huberman’s final thoughts are that when we start making ourselves work for pleasure it will make us crave instant pleasures less. It will also make us feel more motivated and focused to pursue better rewards. By doing this we will slowly increase our attention span back to baseline and become less addicted to instant dopaminergic rushes.  <p>

<h3> My Thoughts </h3>
<p> Overall I agree with Dr. Huberman’s points made in this video because I can personally relate to the things he talked about. I initially chose this YouTube talk because much like Huberman, I think that as a generation our attention spans are decreasing. With today's popularity of social media and smartphones people can easily get addicted to consuming these dopaminergic activities in the palm of their hands. From my personal experience during the pandemic I became slightly addicted to my smartphone and social media. Since everyone was inside all the time, I resorted to finding enjoyment through my phone and social media. This caused me to scroll through social media for hours even if I did not enjoy it. I became dependent on how easy it was to access instant pleasure/gratification through Instagram and tiktok. When school began and classes were online, I found it difficult to sit through an entire Zoom lecture without scrolling on my phone. Thus, my attention span has been lowered because of social media. I was constantly looking for instant dopaminergic releases. In my attempt to fix this issue, I started putting my phone in another room while I was in class. This essentially requires me to make an effort to achieve a reward. As I kept doing this, I slowly became less addicted to my phone and I am now able to sit through lectures without ever touching my phone. <p> 
<p> Even without watching this video during the pandemic a lot of what I did was stated in Dr. Huberman’s YouTube video. He suggested that people who are addicted to any sort of instant pleasure, have to make themselves work for that reward. Given this, our craving for instant gratification will slowly fade away. I made myself unable to instantly access my phone and had to work to get it by placing it in another room, which slowly made my proximity to pleasure fade away. <p> 
<p> One concept that Huberman brought to my attention is that with smartphones people can access over thousands of different dopaminergic contexts within seconds. We are able to switch from scrolling through various amounts of content on social media to watching videos on YouTube. Because this is the first generation that can access many pleasurable context switches instantly, Huberman does not know what this will do to our generation in the long term. However, I think that being able to access thousands of instant sources of dopaminergic pleasure will cause our dopamine systems to become oversaturated faster. This will eventually cause us to become reliant on instant pleasure without requirement for pursuit. Thus, causing us to become addicted to our smartphones and lowering our attention span. <p> 
<p> Huberman suggested that in order to stop addictive behavior, people should stop engaging in the addictive behavior completely. I disagree with this point and as an alternative I believe people should limit their addictive behavior, but not stop it completely. For example if someone is addicted to social media, they shouldn't stop accessing it completely. I suggest they should continue using social media at a moderate level. This allows them to enjoy the things they do without facing the harm that comes with it. <p> 
<p> In conclusion, I agree with almost all of Dr. Huberman’s points in this video. Both Huberman and I believe that as a society people need to limit their consumption of social media because of how addictive it can be. Our proximity to social media and smartphones is easily accessible which causes us as a generation to have a decreasing attention span. We are overconsuming dopamine without any effort to pursue it. This is dangerous as a society because our attention spans are decreasing and people are becoming unmotivated to pursue rewards. Therefore, people should moderate their smartphone usage and any behavior that grants them pleasure. <p>
