<h2> In this video neuroscientist Andrew Huberman states that as a generation our attention spans are decreasing. Huberman's main argument is that people are unable to buffer and control their need for instant pleasure. Our proximity to pleasure today is too easily accessible. The main examples Huberman uses are smartphones and social media. Many people today have smartphones, which is bad for us because of how easy it is for us to access instant pleasure with no requirement to pursue. Because of how easily we are able to access this pleasure, it creates a danger for us as we are chasing and over consuming dopamine without any effort; this causes us as a generation to develop lower attention spans and not actually find any enjoyment out of what we are doing; rather we are just becoming addicted to instant dopaminergic rushes. Everytime we scroll through social media such as tiktok or instagram it is allowing our brains to switch through various sources of dopamine, via scrolling through many different video contents. Normally people were required to go outside or leave the room to obtain multiple sources of dopamine, however with social media we consume over thousands of different context switches in a matter of minutes. Huberman suggests that we need to self regulate because of our oversaturated dopamine circuits and control the amount of time we scroll through social media. When we stop engaging in our addictive behavior then our need for instant pleasure fades away. </h2>
