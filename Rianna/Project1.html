<p id="Biography"><b>Biography</b></p>
	
    <p>Slavoj Žižek is a Slovenian philosopher whose work touches on many topics including psychology, politics, and pop culture. He is primarily influenced by Marxist, Idealist, and psychoanalytic theory– specifically that of Jacques Lacan. Despite his roots in the political world of former Yugoslavia, Žižek has become somewhat of a niche intellectual celebrity in North America due to his unique personality, dry humour and evolving ideology.</p>

<p id="Surplus-Happiness"><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG257cOOnw0">Surplus Happiness</a></b></p>
<p>In his talk, “Surplus Happiness”, Žižek examines and critiques our modern notion of enjoyment and how gluttonous pleasure has become the societal norm.</p>

<p>He begins by explaining that he had been reading a book that mentioned the use of industrial testicle crushing devices as a method of torture by Nazis in concentration camps. This stuck with him, given the cruelty of the idea, but as he went online to learn more, he was taken aback when his Google search for “ball crushers” did not yield more information on Holocaust history. Rather, his screen was filled with dozens of links to sexual torture fetishist groups and toys.
<br><br>
Of course, this isn’t exactly a societal norm, but still, Žižek doesn’t consider it a deviance per se. Instead, he claims this extreme example reveals an underlying trait of human sexuality. That is, <b>to enjoy oppression itself</b>.</p>

<p>→ Why do we gain pleasure from painful oppression?
<br><br>
Žižek draws on the ideas of Lacan, Marx, and Freud to make his proposition: “Power bribes us for our obedience.” In this way, the oppressed exchange their obedience and renunciation of pleasures for pleasure in renunciation itself. In other words: when desire is repressed, what follows is desire for repression.
<br><br>
Further, Žižek cites Lacan and Judith Butler in saying that no pleasure, or enjoyment, is without oppression– meaning all enjoyment is excessive. And yet, enjoyment is inescapable. Even if you decide to prohibit enjoyment, you will find yourself enjoying that prohibition.</p>

<p id="My-Opinion"><b>My Opinion</b></p>

<p>How does one critique Žižek? His ideas, disposition, and distinctive presence are hard to argue with. Not to say he spews the absolute truth, but the way he delivers his talks makes me feel like I need to chew and digest every word for a few business days before I can formulate my own opinion. 
<br><br>
Nevertheless, “Surplus Happiness” is extremely compelling from the jump. The way Žižek progresses from a somewhat silly anecdote about sexual fetishes to a picking apart of fundamental human emotion is delightful. But I of course then find myself having the meta experience of questioning my enjoyment of the material. I especially love his analysis of oppression, and I think it’s useful for people to keep in mind– the oppressor can make the oppressed enjoy their power imbalance. 
<br><br>
However, when Žižek makes the claim that all enjoyment is impure and excessive, he starts to lose me. I do think this is an interesting notion, and I don’t think I would necessarily dispute it, but the way he frames it is almost nihilistic. He seems to portray pleasure in general as negative or unnecessary even though it is unavoidable, which I would disagree with. Perhaps it’s a difference of life experiences, but in my opinion, earthly pleasures are needed to continue through life. There is probably something to be gained by being aware of the nature of our enjoyments, but if we disregard them altogether and adopt such a negative view, what are we living for?</p>
