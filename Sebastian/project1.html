        In his talk There is no Algorithm for Truth, Tom Scott discusses the use of algorithms in filtering YouTube content; to determine suitability for 
        advertisers, keep users on the platform, and encourage more users. He pointed out biases coming out of the algorithms, appearing to target minority groups, such as queer communities as they proportionally spoke about sensitive issues more. Additionally, the methods which YouTube uses to keep users on the platform as long as possible to put out more advertising, favouring clickbait, and algorithms ultimately highlighting relatable, authoritative voices over knowledgeable ones.
