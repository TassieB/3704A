He mentions that one thing that AI has achieved is structure dependence. He explains that humans do not have this capacity through an example of a study done with German speakers. In this study, German speakers were given two invented languages, one based on human language structure and one based on a different structure, such as linear order. The participantâ€™s brains were observed while reading this language. The results showed that while reading the language that violates language rules, brain patterns appeared as if they were solving a puzzle, not understanding language. The results of this study reveal that the human brain is structured in a way where it expects certain things to be true; however, AI is able to achieve things that violate certain assumptions. ');
