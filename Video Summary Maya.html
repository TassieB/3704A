font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Noah Harari begins by stating that
consciousness itself is characterized by the capacity to suffer. We are ethical
and political subjects due to our ability to suffer. Because we have the
ability to feel pain, fear, and pleasure, we are conscious. Throughout history,
it has been: “I feel, therefore I am entitled to speak”. Crimes are acts that
are punishable due to their ability to cause suffering. Stealing a car causes
suffering not for the car (because it is not conscious) but for the owner of
the car, the conscious agent. Historically though, authority used to not come
from feeling, but from something outside of us such as the laws of nature or
Gods. This is how we explain “victimless” crimes such as homosexuality. This
was considered a crime because it was against the laws of nature (God). However
today, we partly measure this “crime” (where it is considered one) by who’s
feelings it affects. He used the gay pride parade in Israel as an example. If
we banned homosexuality, those who are gay would suffer, but when we have gay
pride parades, others complain that they are offensive and cause suffering for
them. Today however, we forbid things like rape and murder, not because God
said so but because they make people suffer. In political elections, we are not
asked “what is true?” but “how do you feel?”; subsequent vote choices come from
feeling. Politics revolves around how to measure suffering and feeling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>Harari emphasizes that we should
not confuse intelligence with consciousness, as intelligence is based on the
ability to problem solve, and consciousness is based on the ability to feel.
While we consider animals as conscious, we establish a consciousness hierarchy
that considers animal consciousness as lesser than ours and consider ourselves
superior to them. Realistically, this has caused more suffering than any other
idea in history. We have already established a consciousness hierarchy with
regard to animals. Could this be extended to other entities? Harari brings up
rapidly advancing artificial intelligence systems. There is a big debate about
creating AI ethics and considering robot feelings. Should we create autonomous
systems that can make their own decisions? Does this mean that they have
feelings? He emphasizes again the difference between intelligence and
consciousness. While planes have the ability to fly without feathers, AI can be
intelligent, and have the ability to make decisions, without being able to
feel. While for humans and other animals, consciousness goes hand in hand with
intelligence, this does not have to be true for AI. If we place too much
emphasis on these two factors relying on the necessity of the other, we may end
up privileging computers and placing them in the hierarchy of consciousness.</span></p>
