His famous notable works relate to the psychology of judgment and decision thinking. The first YouTube video “Thinking Fast and Slow l Daniel Kahneman” was posted by Long Now Foundation, which is an American non-profit organization that advocates for  “slower/better” thinking versus the “faster and cheaper” mentality. Long Now Foundation invited Daniel Kahneman to give his talk about his book - “Thinking, Fast and Slow”  which was published in 2011. He introduced the dual-process model of System 1 and System 2. In the second video, he talks about how cognitive traps can influence the way we think about “happiness”.');
