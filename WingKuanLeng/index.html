    <!-- Paragraph with the specific first letter style applied -->
    <p class="first-letter">
        D<span class="first-letter">aniel Kahneman is a psychologist and an economist. One of his famous notable works relates to the psychology of judgment and decision thinking. He suggested that people often use mental shortcuts that rely on intuition to make judgments and solve problems. He introduced the dual-process model of System 1 and System 2. It is suggested that system 1 is the one that refers to the quick-thinking process, whereas system 2 is the slow-thinking process, that involves critical thinking. He also suggested that people often use and trust system 1 which elicits intuitive judgment. System 1 involves making fast, intuitive decisions, while intuition works unconsciously or subconsciously by blending in the knowledge and experiences that an individual perceives. Experiences often encompass emotions and memories. Kahneman shares his talk about how people perceive happiness between our memories and our experiences. He suggested that people will only enjoy what being happy means by remembering only significant moments or endings of the experience but not the whole experience of what a person felt in a certain context. Thus, Kahneman implies that people only tend to remember a certain part of their experience and it becomes part of our memories. Based on that part of the memories, people subconsciously or unconsciously make decisions using the system 1. This could also relate to the hot cognition hypothesis which suggests that decisions are made based on our perceptions and are influenced by our emotional state. However, the experiences of each individual shape a person's personality and identify who they are or what they want in life. Decision-making happens almost in every moment of our lives. We can decide what we to get in life and experience them by either choosing based on our emotions or our logical reasoning.</span>
