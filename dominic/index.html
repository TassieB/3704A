 <p>Oftentimes, life throws us curveballs that inevitably spiral into an endless struggle. Just like Sisyphus, we push the same boulder up the same hill and it rolls back down on us. When we are challenged in this way, what tools can we use to adapt? This is what Nathaniel Drew, a YouTuber with a vested interest in the human experience, attempts to tackle in his video “The Secret to Thriving in Hard Times (Drew, 2022).” He travels to Vienna to contextualize the question within a culture that encourages the sharing of ideas and art. This culture primarily shows in salons and coffeehouses which serve as a second living place for residents. During the pandemic, these places were not open to provide this space for learning.
 <br>
   Indeed, in the wake of the pandemic most people’s lives have been disrupted to some degree. These ‘hard times’, which can be defined as difficult or prolonged experiences that require us to make sacrifices, are challenging yet necessary experiences for us to have. They create a dissonance between where we are and where we wish to be, spurring a push to improve ourselves and the world around us. It is this uncertainty that instills a sense of unease, prompting us to live with renewed vigour and pursue what truly matters. Uncertainty keeps us on our toes. It is also closely tied to hope, which I believe is an important component of truly thriving. So how do we thrive in hard times, then?
<br>
 Ask this to Drew, and he would suggest five things to keep in mind when navigating this perilous landscape. He emphasizes the importance of challenges for teaching us life lessons, knowing your friends and who you can rely on, adjusting your goals according to your unique phase of life, focusing on what you can control, and approaching new experiences with openness and curiosity. Furthermore, each of these points links back to the concept of hope, which will be explored later. Though this element of hope is missing, I still agree with his perspective, as each point contributes to a larger plan that allows us the capacity to deal with any difficulties we are faced with. Despite this, I believe there is a missing element to this equation. The points posited by Drew are incomplete without a strong sense of hope about one’s future, which calls us to action.
 <br>
   Before delving into why hope is such a critical piece of the puzzle, we need to discuss the points that Drew suggested in more detail. In his opinion, challenges are there to teach us what we need to know, and to guide us towards positive change. By facing difficulties in our lives, we must learn to be better, driven by this new knowledge of what we are doing sub-optimally. Essentially, problems are there to let us know that something is wrong. In Vienna, Drew meets complete strangers with whom he takes a cold dip in the Danube with. He emphasizes setting intentions to focus on objectives outside of ourselves to promote belief in our ability to persevere through uncomfortable experiences.
 <br>
   Additionally, positive change does not come from challenges alone, as friends can be an additional source of reliance and strength. We use them to model ourselves, either helping or hurting each other in a reciprocal relationship. Another aspect to friendship is trust, and who will stick with you when things get serious. If you are in a tough spot, it is almost certain that you will need others to support you through this time. Finding reliable friends that will not give up on you in these times is absolutely crucial to maintaining your ability to endure hard times. Those who support your goals can provide guidance on how to best proceed and be there by your side when you need them the most.
   <br>
   That being said, not all goals will support you at all times in your life. Drew argues that people go through different phases of life, where each phase must include compatible goals and expectations. He expands on this idea to suggest that people go through cycles which repeat themselves, and that actions that are helpful at one stage in the cycle are harmful in another. This is why it is critical to recognize that different people need different things, and to remain open to the possibility of changing your mind.
   <br>
   Expanding on this, Drew draws from stoic philosophy when he talks about focusing on what we can control, and letting go of what we cannot. The impact lies where there is a possibility for change, therefore trying to change what you simply cannot is a fruitless time-wasting endeavour. Much more useful is living in the present moment and focusing on what you can influence, yet this does not mean closing yourself off to your potential. This is where a sense of openness and curiosity come into play, as a genuine wonder about the world contributes to a can-do attitude concerning your goals and priorities. Drew draws on two main functions here: the willingness to experience new things and people and improving one’s outlook with forward thinking. Both elements inspire us to rethink what we believe to be true, effectively opening us up to a myriad of possibilities for our future and everyone else’s.
   <br>
   All this being said, where does hope fit into the picture? In introducing the concept of hope, it is useful to consider real life examples. History has seen its fair share of harsh environments and conditions, and hope has remained a crucial part of these historical landscapes. Holocaust survivor and renowned author Victor Frankl recounts his time in the concentration camps in his book Man’s Search for Meaning (Frankl, 1946), wherein he makes a strong argument for hope and having a good reason to live for. His proposal is that we must keep hope alive by means of having something important enough to hope for. To bolster this argument, he borrows a powerful quote from Nietzsche: “Wer ein Warum zu Leben hat, erträgt fast jedes Wie.” In English, this roughly translates to “He who has a why to live for, can bear with almost any how.” In the concentration camps, Frankl had to keep his mind on the future to survive. He focused on his work concerning logotherapy and his wife, who he would imagine conversing with. What kept him going was that he had something to live for, highlighting the importance of having a strong sense of purpose. Aside from describing his own experiences, he discusses the experiences of others. Those who had lost all their aspirations for the future did not last long in the camps, and would quickly get sick and perish, having lost all their strength. When a person gives up, their body appears to follow suit, so it is especially important to have a strong belief in yourself and your purpose to survive excruciating experiences. This is not isolated to extreme circumstances, however, and happens to everybody at some point in their lives.
   <br>
   Concordantly, hope has helped me a great deal in my own life, allowing me to stay positive even in the worst situations. Trusting the process of healing and the actions that would get me there allowed me to stick with it through my hardest times. By orienting myself toward a future of possibilities, where hope is the guiding beacon of light, I am able to remain rooted in reality without losing myself. Each of the suggestions from Drew have also been instrumental in my journey of self-improvement and thriving in unforgiving environments yet hope gave me the inspiration to continue dreaming each day. Without it, everyday life would seen empty and hollow. It gives me something to look forward to when all is said and done and instills in me a newfound strength.
   <br>
   Moreover, hope has the power to heal. It does not solve any problems by itself, but it allows for the possibility to solve them in the future. Without a strong hope that things can and will be better, it is near impossible to move yourself to reach your goals. Hope is uncertainty, leaning on the side of the possible. Hope is not false belief coloured by rose-tinted glasses, or an all-abiding optimism that ignores common sense. At its core, the mechanisms of hope inspire us to try, to give it our all, and to never give up. Applying this concept of hope to the points outlined by Drew can clarify where it fits in. For challenges, it allows for the impossible to become possible. We can hope to find people that support us through our difficulties. When our goals shift, hope is there to show us the right path to success. If we feel out of control, there is hope that what we can control will benefit us if we take advantage of its presence. Finally, hope is the basis of curiosity and a willingness to learn. In all aspects of life, especially those that are particularly testing, hope emerges as the common denominator.
   <br>
   In conclusion, while the points brought up by Drew are necessary to include, they are underpinned by hope, which stands to bolster our underlying reasons to live. In situations that seek to tear us down, by keeping these points in mind and hoping for a better future, we are all able to thrive in hard times. This was true in the concentration camps like Frankl experienced, and it is true in today’s world, ravaged by the pandemic. Equipped with this knowledge, it is possible to avoid falling into the same trap as Sisyphus, ultimately going nowhere. To ascend the endless struggle, we must instill in each other a hope that we can get through anything. In the future, there will surely be more problems to deal with, such as global warming or overpopulation. Yet it remains possible that these issues can and will be solved if hope decrees it to be so. Once we find our reason to live, we can bear the harshest future looming on the horizon, and perhaps even thrive as we face it with open arms.
