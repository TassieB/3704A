 <p>Oftentimes, life throws us curveballs that inevitably spiral into an endless struggle. Just like Sisyphus, we push the same boulder up the same hill and it rolls back down on us. When we are challenged in this way, what tools can we use to adapt? This is what Nathaniel Drew, a YouTuber with a vested interest in the human experience, attempts to tackle in his video “The Secret to Thriving in Hard Times (Drew, 2022).” He travels to Vienna to contextualize the question within a culture that encourages the sharing of ideas and art. This culture primarily shows in salons and coffeehouses which serve as a second living place for residents. During the pandemic, these places were not open to provide this space for learning.

   Indeed, in the wake of the pandemic most people’s lives have been disrupted to some degree. These ‘hard times’, which can be defined as difficult or prolonged experiences that require us to make sacrifices, are challenging yet necessary experiences for us to have. They create a dissonance between where we are and where we wish to be, spurring a push to improve ourselves and the world around us. It is this uncertainty that instills a sense of unease, prompting us to live with renewed vigour and pursue what truly matters. Uncertainty keeps us on our toes. It is also closely tied to hope, which I believe is an important component of truly thriving. So how do we thrive in hard times, then?
