   <p>When life gives us difficult situations, how do we deal with them? This is the question 
  that Nathaniel Drew attempts to tackle with this video, and through his journey to Vienna he 
  uncovers some key concepts that work toward an answer to this question. The uncertainty that
  exists in the world, especially now, is something that can make us indecisive and unsure of our 
  role in it all. Yet by keeping some key ideas in mind, it is possible to navigate this landscape.</p>
  <p>Firstly, the challenges we encounter are there to teach us. There are times when we must change,
    and the problems are there to guide us along the way. It is equally important to know your friends,
    and who you can rely on. When things get serious, it becomes clear who you can trust. In addition,
    everyone goes through certain phases of life that are always shifting. It is critical to find goals
    that align with where you are in the present moment. Another element to consider is the objective lack
    of control that we have on events external to us. By focusing on what we can control, we make the largest impact. 
    Lastly, approaching each situation and experience with openness and curiosity allows for a better outlook, and 
    inspires us to look forward instead of backward. </p>
