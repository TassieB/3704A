  <h2>Summary </h1>
  <br>
  <h2> In this presentation, Elizabeth Loftus talks about the unreliability of memory and how easy it is to creates false memory. She also discused how there is practically no difference between a real and a false memory, which means our opinions can be easily skewed by false memory. Furthermore she raised the question on how much negative effect AI will have, now that we can create about anything and share false information easier than ever. <h1>
