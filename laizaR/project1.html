<h2> At a basic level memory is an easy concept to understand. We experience events or we learn facts that are then stored in our brains for us to retrieve when needed. However, when you start studying the processes and phenomena associated with memory, things become a little tricker. Elizabeth Loftus is a well-known name in the cognitive science community for her work and findings on memory, more specifically, the misinformation effect and rich false memories. She first took interest in the subject when she noticed the rise of adults reporting childhood sexual abuse or traumatic cult sacrifice in the 90s. These adults were all going to therapy and uncovered repressed memories of these traumatic events. After a thorough investigation, it was found that no cult sacrifice happened in that period. Elizabeth took an interest and started her research to find how and why these individuals believed they experienced such events with such vivid details. 
  <br>
In the video, Elizabeth Loftus talks about the misinformation effect which is a phenomenon where someone’s recollection of an event can be changed with suggestive questioning and the right phrasing. For example, if you went out for dinner and the server asked you how good the meal was, you might remember the food as being very good in a few weeks even if you didn’t like it that much. Discovering the misinformation effect reformed how police interrogations are conducted and the impact of eyewitnesses on justice cases. They prevented millions from being wrongfully accused and incarcerated. I believe in these findings because there are multiple cases, and studies that prove it. 
<br>
She also explains how the misinformation effect can be taken to a bigger scale and that we can create memories from our childhood or our younger self of events that never occurred to us. She calls those rich false memories. These false memories create the same pattern of brain waves and are believed to be just as emotionally charged as true memories. According to Loftus, that makes false memories indistinguishable from true memories. 
Firstly, I believe that rich false memories might not be as charged as true memories because, in my opinion, these claims are based on results that could have had factors they did not account for. The study that led to that conclusion was as follows. The participants were people who believed they had been abducted by aliens, an event that according to the researcher was highly unlikely, thus a rich false memory. These individuals exhibited signs of emotional distress, such as quickened heartbeat and high blood pressure, when recollecting the events. The conclusion made based on the results was that a rich false memory of a traumatic event exhibited the same emotional reaction as a true memory of a traumatic event. The first flaw I see in this study is that they didn’t have a control group. How can we tell if the physical changes recorded in the participants were due to their emotional response from the recollection of the events and not from the environment itself? After all, talking to a psychologist and answering their question for a study can be stressful for some. So, the quickened heartbeats could be caused by the unfamiliarity of the environment. In addition, the emotional response could also be due to the stress of not being believed or being perceived as crazy. I will assume that most participants had either talked about their abduction with others which was probably not believed and received well or didn’t talk about it in the fear of being judged. In both cases, the participants might have felt like they would be perceived a certain way which could explain the emotional response. Finally, it is not mentioned in the study I read how the false memory had been planted. Is there a possibility that the participants had paranoid schizophrenia or that they had a dream so vivid it felt real? And if so, would the abduction still considered a false memory?
Secondly, some clinical practitioners believe that temporarily forgotten memory caused by dissociative amnesia could be wrongfully labeled as rich false memory. Areas of research used to support the theory of dissociative amnesia are retrieval inhibition, for example how some smells can trigger a memory that you haven’t thought of in many years, motivated forgetting, how people actively try to not think about the event and forget the trauma, and the relation between trauma and dissociation. Furthermore,  the inclusion of dissociative amnesia in the DSM-5 has cemented the belief in repressed memory in clinical practitioners and laypersons alike. The memories are usually retrieved in memories when therapists try to link behaviors to unhealed childhood trauma. Memory experts such as Elizabeth do not believe in dissociative amnesia and here are some of the key counterarguments on the matter:
<br>
-	Every day forgetfulness might be falsely interpreted as dissociative amnesia.
  <br>
-	Dissociative amnesia could be wrongly diagnosed instead of organic amnesia.
  <br>
-	Failed recollection of a traumatic event could simply be a failure of encoding.
  <br>
-	Victims of abuse might be reticent to talk about their abuse because of the negative view of the society on victims. A lack of disclosure does not mean a repression of the event. 
<br>
-	A failure of trauma recollection that occurred before the age of three can be miss-diagnosed as dissociative amnesia instead of childhood amnesia.
<br>
-	Most patients that experience traumatic events have flashbacks and intrusive memories of the event even if they actively want to forget it. 
<br>
Both sides bring compelling ideas to the table, however, they both have some weaker arguments. On one hand, it isn’t uncommon for an individual to remember and retrieve an event from their lives that they had not thought about in years from their memory. However, repressive memory has been proven to be. On the other hand, memory has been proven to be faulty and easily manipulated. However, I believe that the study I used as a reference relies too heavily on the victims of the traumatic abuse having PTSD. They compared the symptoms of patients diagnosed with dissociative amnesia with people who had PTSD following trauma multiple times in the paper one of them being in the arguments above. Studies have shown that not everyone develops PTSD following a traumatic event, so claiming that an event can’t be intentionally forgotten because people who experience such events have flashbacks would be an overgeneralization of people's reactions following trauma. I do believe that rich false memories exist, however, I don’t think we should generalize every memory that is retrieved or inhibited as false. 
<br>
Finally, I believe Elizabeth Loftus brings an important concern. The accessibility offered by the internet to spread misinformation as well as the rapid improvement of AI to edit and create pictures and videos is concerning. Under the wrong hands, these tools could be used to create false memories and beliefs in the minds of the viewers. And, if Elizabeth is right, there would be no way of knowing which memory is authentic and which isn’t. This is why we need to teach children how to think critically and question what others tell them no matter how confident and sure they seem with their claim. As adults, our responsibility is to teach the next generation how to fact-check and to welcome and nourish their curiosity even if they question us. If we stop telling kids things are the way they are or that things are true because we said so, we can raise the next generation to be critical thinkers. In addition, I believe that A.I. developers also hold a responsibility to make it possible for people to identify what has been A.I. generated or edited with the help of their tools to help people know when they need to be vigilant.
