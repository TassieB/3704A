        <p>Janelle Shane is a research scientist in optics. Her work involves creating computer-controlled holograms to study the brain. 
          Additionally, she runs a blog about machine learning called 
          <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/">aiweirdness</a>.
          , where she writes about weird things that artificial intellgence comes up with. She conducts experiments that prompts 
          different AI models to generate recipes, paint colours, cat names, candy heart messages, etc. 
          Her work has been featured in New York Times, The Atlantic, WIRED, Popular Science, All Things Considered, and Slate. 
          Furthermore, she was honored as a TED fellow in 2019. I included her TED Talk below, where she explains that AI is more 
          silly than it is dangerous. She has also authored her own book, 
          <a href=https://mybook.to/YouLookLikeAThing>"You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: How AI Works and Why it's Making the World a Weirder Place"</a>.
          Much like her TED talk, in her book she talks about silly solutions that AIs come up with and examines just how intelligent they truly are.

      <h4>The Dangers of AI is Weirder Than You Think</h4>
      <iframe width="600" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OhCzX0iLnOc?si=Xao-rA71LYVKk5o6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p></p>In this video, Janelle Shane demonstrates that the way we train AI can significantly impact its performance. 
      If we do not provide clear instructions, it tends to product unexpected solutions to problems. One of the examples she 
      provided was an experiment that tasked an AI with navigating an obstacle course in a virtual environment. The expected outcome 
      was that it would create a "body" and use its legs to run across the course. But instead, it made itself into a giant tower. 
      When it toppled over, it reached the end of the obstacle course. Shane likened the intelligence of modern AI to that of an 
      earthworm or even less. Although AI can follow instructions well, it lacks an understanding of what it's doing and what it 
      should be doing. As a result, AI tends to come up with unconventional, and sometimes silly, solutions. </p>

    <h2 class="margin" id="opinion">My Opinion</h2>
    <p>I appreciate Shane’s humorous approach to AI. The media frequently portrays AI as malevolent, and we often warned about
      potential Terminator scenarios. However, Shane's perspective on AI is much more light-hearted and she demonstrates that 
      currently AI is not really that smart as the media often portrays it to be. Apart from her views on AI, I do not know much
        else about her, as she primarily focuses on “AI weirdness” on her social media. Nonetheless, based on what I can discern,
        she seems to have a sense of humour!
