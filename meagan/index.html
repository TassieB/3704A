        <p>Janelle Shane is a research scientist in optics. Her work involves creating computer-controlled holograms to study the brain. She also runs a blog about machine learning, 
          <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/">aiweirdness</a>.
          In her blog, she writes about weird things that artificial intellgence comes up with. She runs experiments that prompts
          different AI models to generate receipes, paint colours, cat names, and candy heart messages. Her work has been published
          in New York Times, The Atlantic, WIRED, Popular Science, All Things Considered, and Slate. In addition, she is also a 2019 TED fellow.
          She has also written her own book, "You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: How AI Works and Why it's Making the World a Weirder Place".

    <h2 class="margin">My Opinion</h2>
    <p>She seems like a good person. I like her approach to AI from a more humourous perspective. Often in the media, AI is 
      portrayed as evil, and we often warned that they might end up like Terminator. However, Shane's appraoch to AI is much more light-hearted and 
      she shows that current AI is not really that smart as the media makes it out to be. AI still makes mistakes, and those mistakes differ from what
      humans do.

    <h2 class="margin">Video Summary</h2>
    <h4>The Dangers of AI is Weirder Than You Think</h4>
    <iframe width="600" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OhCzX0iLnOc?si=Xao-rA71LYVKk5o6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p></p>In this video, Janelle Shane demonstrates that the way we train AI can greatly affect its performance. If we do not give it 
    give it clear instructions, it will tend to do something unexpected to solve the problem. One of the examples she gave was of an experiement
    that asked an AI to go across an obstacle course (in a virtual environment). The expected outcome was that it would create a "body" and use its
    legs to run across the course. But instead, it made itself into a giant tower, and when it falls down it can reach the end of the obstacle course.
    Shane compared modern AI intelligence to a earthworm or less. Although AI can follow instructions well, it doesn't have an understanding of what it's doing
    and what it should be doing. As a result, AI can can up with some weird solutions.</p>
