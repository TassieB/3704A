  <p>In this video, Janelle Shane demonstrates that the way we train AI can greatly affect its performance. If we do not give it <br>
  give it clear instructions, it will tend to do something unexpected to solve the problem. One of the examples she gave was of an experiement<br>
  that asked an AI to go across an obstacle course (in a virtual environment). The expected outcome was that it would create a "body" and use its<br>
  legs to run across the course. But instead, it made itself into a giant tower, and when it falls down it can reach the end of the obstacle course.<br>
  Shane compared modern AI intelligence to a earthworm or less. Although AI can follow instructions well, it doesn't have an understanding of what it's doing<br>
  and what it should be doing. As a result, AI can can up with some weird solutions.</p>
