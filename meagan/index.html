      Often in the media, AI is portrayed as dangerous and bent on destroying humanity. However, Janelle Shane offers a different view. She compares the intelligence of AI
      to an earthworm and highlights silly mistakes made by AIs. Her comedic approach helps educate and alliveate people's fears of AI through her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhCzX0iLnOc">TED Talk</a>, 
      <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/">blog</a>, and social media. She is a cognitive digital celebrity scientist as she foucses on AI and evaluates their problem solving skills in relation to typical human responses.

        <p>Janelle Shane is a research scientist in optics. Her work involves creating computer-controlled holograms to study the brain. 
          Additionally, she runs a blog about machine learning called 
          <a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/">aiweirdness</a>.
          , where she writes about weird things that artificial intellgence comes up with. She conducts experiments that prompts 
          different AI models to generate recipes, paint colours, cat names, candy heart messages, etc. 
          Her work has been featured in New York Times, The Atlantic, WIRED, Popular Science, All Things Considered, and Slate. 
          Furthermore, she was honored as a TED fellow in 2019. I included her TED Talk below, where she explains that AI is more 
          silly than it is dangerous. She has also authored her own book, 
          <a href=https://mybook.to/YouLookLikeAThing>"You Look Like a Thing and I Love You: How AI Works and Why it's Making the World a Weirder Place"</a>.
          Much like her TED talk, in her book she talks about silly solutions that AIs come up with and examines just how intelligent they truly are.

    <p>
      In her blog, she mostly writes about her experiments where she asks different AI models to generate results given a certain prompt. 
      She analyzes the results to ensure that the AI is generating new ideas and that it is not just repeating the training data.
      If she is unsatisfied with the results, she tries to find better ways to train the AI. The result is creative responses from an AI.

      <h4>The Dangers of AI is Weirder Than You Think</h4>
      <iframe width="600" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OhCzX0iLnOc?si=Xao-rA71LYVKk5o6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p></p>In this video, Janelle Shane demonstrates that the way we train AI can significantly impact its performance. 
      If we do not provide clear instructions, it tends to product unexpected solutions to problems. One of the examples she 
      provided was an experiment that tasked an AI with navigating an obstacle course in a virtual environment. The expected outcome 
      was that it would create a "body" and use its legs to run across the course. But instead, it made itself into a giant tower. 
      When it toppled over, it reached the end of the obstacle course. Shane likened the intelligence of modern AI to that of an 
      earthworm or even less. Although AI can follow instructions well, it lacks an understanding of what it's doing and what it 
      should be doing. As a result, AI tends to come up with unconventional, and sometimes silly, solutions. Despite the humour, Shane brings
      up an important point that scientists and other users of artificial intellgence need to mindful of, the importance of giving AI clear instructions.
      AIs do not think like us as they are not programmed in the same way we are. In order to better understand AI, we need to think more of how an AI will respond.
      Additionally, this concept is also important not just in AI, but also in the general field of computer science. When programmers are coding, they must be very 
      explicit when writing their programs because computers take things very literally, similarily to AI.

    <h2 class="margin" id="opinion">My Opinion</h2>
    <p>I appreciate Shane’s humorous approach to AI. The media frequently portrays AI as malevolent, and we often warned about
      potential Terminator scenarios. However, Shane's perspective on AI is much more light-hearted and she demonstrates that 
      currently AI is not really that smart as the media often portrays it to be. Apart from her views on AI, I do not know much
        else about her, as she primarily focuses on “AI weirdness” on her blog and social media. I can see why she tries to keep her 
        professional life and personal life separate in the "cogsphere" because it is very hard to have privacy on the internet, especially for celebrities.
